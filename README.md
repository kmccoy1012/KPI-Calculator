# KPI-Calculator
/* This is a tool i created for myself and other district managers while working at Speedway LLC.
At Speedway, store managers are measured by 19 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics.
The formula for a store manager to be "executing" is as follows:
Below goal = Red, value of 1 point
Near goal = Yellow, value of 2.35 points.
At or above goal = Green, value of 3.69 points.
The goal for an "executing" store manager is to be at 52.

This program allows district managers to estimate their results well before the KPI reports come up over
a month after the month in question. You can select either one, two, or three months for an entire quarter and the
program will do the calculations for you.
